# QuestSearch

**QuestSearch** is an advanced search platform engineered to deliver fast, precise, and scalable search capabilities for extensive collections of questions. It integrates MongoDB Atlas Full-Text Search for efficient and flexible querying, while gRPC serves as the core of the search service for high-performance communication. An Express.js middleware bridges the gap between the gRPC service and the frontend, managing API routing, cross-origin requests, and seamless backend-to-frontend communication. The frontend is developed with Vite + React to ensure a modern, smooth, and intuitive user experience.

## Key Highlights

- **Efficient Full-Text Search**: Employs MongoDB Atlas Full-Text Search to efficiently query question titles, ensuring accurate and speedy results.
- **Paginated Results**: Provides pagination to streamline user navigation and optimize search response times.
- **Customizable Filters**: Enables filtering questions by categories such as Multiple Choice, Anagram, Read Along, and more for a refined search experience.
- **Adaptive Design**: Fully responsive interface for an optimal user experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **High-Performance API**: Powered by a gRPC-based API to handle search requests efficiently, with Express.js acting as a middleware to route data and manage cross-origin communication seamlessly.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for handling large datasets, utilizing MongoDB's indexing features to maximize search performance and ensure scalability.
